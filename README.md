# project-evergreen
A frontend repository designed for lean, performant, and sustainable web applications. Inspired by the [Poylmer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) project.

## Overview
The mission of **Project Evergreen** is to provide future-forward, standards complient resources for building dynamic, performant, and evergreen web applications that are designed to be easy to understand and intuitive to use by both users and developers.

> This repo stands as a general issue / feature tracker.

### State of the Web
With the current state of the web platform, we can now look to the web to give us a lot of the tooling and features we have often looked to libraries and frameworks to help us with.  The web is moving towards a persistently progressive app development environment that supports shared values like:
* Powerful standard language features for both JavaScript and CSS
* Long-term, backwards compatibility support from the web platform itself
* Favoring the use of polyfills over frameworks, best practices, and modern UI patterns
* Positive developer experiences to support rapid development

## Documentation
Please see our [wiki](https://github.com/projectevergreen/project-evergreen/wiki) for information about usage, examples, documentation, and more.

Visit our [website](https://project-evergreen.thegreenhouse.io/) for background information on the project's motivations and [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PrjEvergreen) to get the latest updates from the team.  The [source code](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/website) is written in Evergreen JS / CSS and so provides a nice introductory example of the project's goals.

## Roadmap
In general our first couple goals are to:
1. Build [the website](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/projectevergreen.github.io) with "evergreen" JavaScript / CSS
1. Create a [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md) example
1. Build up documentation, examples, and use cases

See our [projects](https://github.com/projectevergreen/project-evergreen/projects) and [milestones](https://github.com/projectevergreen/project-evergreen/milestones) to view our general Roadmap and priorities.
