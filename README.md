# project-evergreen

## Overview
A frontend repository designed for lean, performant, and sustainable web applications. Inspired by the [Poylmer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) project.

### Mission
The mission of **Project Evergreen** is to provide a web application blueprint for building dynamic, performant, and evergreen (naturally) web applications that are designed to be easy to understand and intuitive to use by both users and developers.

The project's motivations are rooted in the fundamental belief that applications should be as standards compliant as possible to maximize the experience for users, developers, and businesses. The web platform has supports us here as it has moved towards a persistently progressive application development environment that supports our shared values.

Ultimately though, our apps need to please our users.

Our goals are clear: _Be easy to write, be easy to maintain, and be easy to deploy.  Our users will appreciate it._
